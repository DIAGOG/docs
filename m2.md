M2
==

M2 is an open source automotive interface that can take your car to the next level. Use it to unlock your car's potential or as a development platform for your next product.

M2 is a complete overhaul of our 1.X generation of Macchina. The goals are still the same: Create an easy-to-use, fully-open, and super-compatible automotive interface. This time, we have improved processing power, designed a smaller form factor and more communication options. We still have all of the physical interfaces to allow communication to most any car, new and old built in.
