Automotive interfaces
=====================

The lower board of M2 contains both the power supply circuitry and the automotive interfaces required to communicate with your car. This includes:

- 2x CAN bus
- 1x SWCAN (single wire can)
- 2x LIN/9141
- J1805 VPW/PWM

In addition, every M2 has a 26 pin "expansion" connector that provides even more connection options. For example: UART, SPI, I2C, general purpose 12V drivers and 12V analog inputs. See the schematic for actual pinout details:
