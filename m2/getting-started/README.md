# Getting Started

## What’s in the Box?
Inside your box you should find the following:


<img src="/images/WIB_UTD.png" width="640" />

- M2 (UTD or UTH)
- 26 pin cable harness kit
- 24 pin cable harness kit (UTH version only)
- Window sticker
- Start up card

## Quick projects

There are many ways you can write code and work with M2. One of the quickest and easiest ways is to use the Arduino IDE (Integrated Development Environment) which is what this documentation will use. Many other development environments work well including [Atmel Studio](http://www.microchip.com/development-tools/atmel-studio-7) and [Simulink®](https://www.mathworks.com/products/simulink.html).

## Enclosures

It’s ok to do some initial setup before you have an enclosure, but before your M2 spends long periods in the car please consider protecting it. We have a few configurations of enclosures designed and ready for 3D printing. You can download the designs, tweak them as needed, print, share, lather, rinse, repeat.
