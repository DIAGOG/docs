## Quick projects:

## Enclosures:

It’s ok to do some initial setup before you have an enclosure, but before your M2 spends long periods in the car please consider protecting it. We have a few configurations of enclosures designed and ready for 3D printing. You can download the designs, tweak them as needed, print, share, lather, rinse, repeat.
