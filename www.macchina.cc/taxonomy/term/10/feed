&lt;p&gt;This is very exciting for us.  We would like to thank everyone that has helped us make this possible.  Aaron, Andy, Brian, Chris, Dan, Dave, Doug, Dustin, Helen, Jeff, Johnny, Kat, Ken, Mark, Melissa, Merlin, Rainer and Special Interest Auto Service; this would have been very difficult without you all.  We would also like to thank the organizations that believed in our mission prior to launch even. Arduino, DIGI International, Digi-Key, Hackaday, Open Garages, and the EFF.  Most importantly all of the car nerds out there that encouraged us to keep going and get this built. &lt;/p&gt;

 <title>A Glimpse Inside M2</title>
 <link>https://www.macchina.cc/content/glimpse-inside-m2</link>
 <description>&lt;div class=&quot;field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-items&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-item even&quot; property=&quot;content:encoded&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;As we set out to create the best open-source automotive interface we could make, we had several goals in mind. We wanted to build something that was as universal-as-possible, small, easy-to-use, versatile and low cost. We believe we did that. The challenge was to jam as many automotive protocol interfaces into a small space, but still retain a low cost to appeal to the largest audience. At the same time, we leveraged and will continue to contribute to the huge open source community. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Our Design Goals&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;row&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;col-md-8&quot;&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Automotive focus:&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt; The M2 circuitry is designed specifically to interface with your car.  The components baked into M2 are perfectly capable of the same features as most high-end tuning/performance, diagnostics, and monitoring hardware on the market.  We hope to make car modification and maintenance more open and affordable to everyone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Compact:&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt; The area under the dash and the nooks under the hood are very small, so we made M2 is as small as we can make it (2.90&quot; x 1.75&quot; x 0.9&quot;). This was no small task, shrinking the Due by well over 50% and THEN adding all of the interface circuits was one of our biggest challenges. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Modular/Upgradable:&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Modularity is our hedge against the future - for example, we segregated the processing from the automotive interface onto 2 boards. Automotive interfaces won&#039;t change as quickly as processor technology and this allows future swaps to different (cheaper/faster/better) processors. In addition, the wireless socket (XBEE format) allows for a wide variety of wireless connectivity options. Finally the open source enclosure design leaves you free to choose, design or tweak the case until it is right for your project.   &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Open Source:&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt; The Arduino IDE is well known and adopted, by basing our processor board on the Arduino Due we have provided a familiar programing experience with an existing help network. In addition, the enormous amount of existing libraries and code out there helps to speed your development. No need to reinvent the wheel.
    &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;col-md-4&quot;&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Let&#039;s take a closer look at the hardware features:&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;row&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;col-md-4&quot;&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
      &lt;img src=&quot;/sites/default/files/exploded.jpg&quot; width=&quot;300&quot; height=&quot;376&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;inserted&quot; style=&quot;width: 100%;&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;col-md-8&quot;&gt;
We&#039;ve carefully selected the best features to ensure compatibility and durability while remaining low in cost. Coming from a consumer-electronics background, our strengths lie in hardware design and manufacturing. Our focus has alway been on automotive applications and our design is an attempt at the best form factor for your car.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div id=&quot;techspecs&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;textsummary&quot;&gt;
&lt;table class=&quot;table table-striped&quot;&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;b&gt;Wireless Socket&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Add a wireless option if you want, for example: BLE, WIFI, GSM, 3G, LTE, ... We use the XBEE &quot;form-factor&quot; here. &lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;b&gt;Processor&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;The same Atmel SAM3X8E processor used on Arduino DUE - a 32-bit ARM Cortex M3 architecture running at 84MHz.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;b&gt;MicroSD Card Socket&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;HSMCI (or SPI) interface for all your high speed data logging needs. RTOS anyone?&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;b&gt;Micro USB&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;USB 2.0 also allows Macchina to act as both a USB Device and Host.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;b&gt;LEDs&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;5 one-color and 1 RGB programmable indicators. Great for debugging.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;b&gt;Memory&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;32k EEPROM for non-volatile memory via I2C, 512 KB for the user applications, 96 KB SRAM.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;b&gt;GPIO Pins&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;6 Automotive level IO Pins to Control 12V devices (Examples: relays, fans, lights, etc) OR act as analog input (like temp sensor).&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;b&gt;Power Supplies&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;5V@ 3 amps, 3.3V@ 1 amps for connecting add ons with worrying about power issues.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;b&gt;Automotive interface Circuits&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;2 channels of CAN, 2 channels of LIN/ K-line, J1850 VPW/PWM, Single-wire CAN interfaces for maximum car compatibility.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We chose these parts so we could hit a certain design focus and philosophy.  The focus has alway been the automotive world and our design is an attempt at the best form factor for your car.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;row&quot;&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;col-md-6&quot;&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;/sites/default/files/DashOrHood.png&quot; width=&quot;675&quot; height=&quot;284&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;inserted&quot; style=&quot;width: 100%;&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;col-md-6&quot;&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Versatility &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Macchina Hardware is available in two different form factors, one that can be wired Under-The-Hood (UTH) and the other that is easily installed Under-The-Dash (UTD) via the OBD2 port standard in all modern vehicles.  The UTH version is a bit more permanent and can access other vehicle networks that are not exposed through the OBD2 port.  The UTD M2 is easy to install and work with while still being mostly out of the way.  The two versions share the same M2 core and only differ in connector type.  M2&#039;s core has a modular design for flexibility,  a processor that can keep up with modern cars, a design that fits anywhere, and a common programming experience through Arduino.
    &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;row&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;col-md-6&quot;&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Testing and Design&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Through our experience in developing embedded and consumer electronics, we know how to make things. Iteration is key. Since our first shipping Macchina back in 2010 to now, we have worked with our loyal customers and friends to keep improving, learning and developing Macchina. Taking all of this feedback, we now have something to show for it. For the last several months, we have been testing and USING our latest M2 hardware. We are excited to share it with you soon. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;col-md-6&quot;&gt;

 <title>And you may ask yourself: Well...How did [we] get here?</title>
 <link>https://www.macchina.cc/content/and-you-may-ask-yourself-wellhow-did-we-get-here</link>
 <description>&lt;div class=&quot;field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-items&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-item even&quot; property=&quot;content:encoded&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Several years ago (10!?), a group of friends decided to build an electric car. More specifically, we converted an old Ford Contour to electric by replacing the existing gasoline motor with an electric motor and the fuel tank with batteries. Sweet ride, eh?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/sites/default/files/image5.png&quot; width=&quot;900&quot; height=&quot;285&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;inserted&quot; style=&quot;width: 100%;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rather quickly we realized that a major obstacle was convincing the various computers within the car to not be upset after its engine had gone missing. We wanted the gears in the automatic transmission to shift at the ideal time, the fuel gauge to display battery capacity and generally wanted our “new” car to perform exactly how we wanted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/sites/default/files/M0.9_ISO_SMALLER.jpg&quot; class=&quot;inserted&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/sites/default/files/styles/medium/public/M0.9_ISO_SMALLER.jpg?itok=EyjknoYY&quot; width=&quot;220&quot; height=&quot;147&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;image-medium inserted&quot; style=&quot;float: left; margin-right: 25px; margin-bottom: 25px;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our challenge stemmed from the closed, unpublished nature of modern-day car computers. We had to figure out how to talk with it. After cobbling together off-the-shelf components and hacking together some code, we eventually reverse engineered what was needed to meet our specific requirements. From there we built a prototype board with everything we needed in one place. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here is a very early prototype. This first prototype was designed to be as universal and open as possible and compatible with all OBD2 signaling protocols have a sturdy power supply and designed with automotive standards in mind. We also made sure it was “Arduino Compatible” so that the volume of code libraries out there could be re-used.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As we tested this prototype, we made sure to keep track of what worked well and what could be improved. For example, we started with a RJ-45 connector to break out the OBD2 protocols, but quickly realized that splicing together wires is no fun. A screw-terminal block would work a lot better. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some circuits worked well, some didn’t - notice the blue-wires? As with any hardware development project, iteration is key. Design, Build, Test, Repeat. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Somewhere along the line, we thought others might benefit from this and other EV-conversion solutions we came up with. We started a business called RechargeCar and began producing and selling a handful of EV related products, including Macchina. Here you see an image of our first “shipping” Macchina (announced at the very first EVCCON in 2011) where we eventually produced a few hundred. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/sites/default/files/IMG_2052-4.jpg&quot; class=&quot;inserted&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/sites/default/files/styles/medium/public/IMG_2052-4.jpg?itok=DH_HI980&quot; width=&quot;220&quot; height=&quot;128&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;image-medium inserted&quot; style=&quot;float: left; margin-right: 25px; margin-bottom: 25px;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Macchina 1.0 still had some minor issues, but overall was a very successful product. Read more about it here in our documentation section (insert link to docs)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More recently, we decided it was time to reach beyond the niche world of EV conversions to ALL the other cars out there. We spun off Macchina as a stand-alone project with a wider market in mind while staying true to our original goals. This iteration of Macchina is more modular, more compact and more powerful while being less expensive. We call it Macchina 2.0.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our hope is to continue growing and evolving this project with the reenvisioned goal of giving everyone the ability to learn something about car networks, to create better tools, to improve security/safety and generally build cool car projects. We need your help.&lt;/p&gt;
